Game Overview: Pig Dice Game

The Pig Dice Game is a simple, yet strategic game for two players. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a single die and have two choices after each roll:

Roll – Roll the die and add the outcome to their current score for that turn.
Hold – Add the current score to their overall score and pass the turn to the other player.
However, there's a catch! If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in their current turn, and their turn ends immediately, switching to the next player.

The first player to reach or exceed 100 points in their overall score wins the game!

Game Strategy Tips:

Decide when to hold or roll based on your current score, risk tolerance, and distance from 100 points.
Gauge your opponent's score and progress to make strategic moves!
Good luck, and may the best roller win!
