The Pig Dice Game is a simple, yet strategic game for two players. The goal is to be the first to reach 100 points. Players take turns rolling a single dice and have two choices after each roll:

Roll – Roll the dice and add the outcome to their current score for that turn.
Hold – Add the current score to their overall score and pass the turn to the other player.
However, there's a catch! If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in their current turn, and their turn ends immediately, switching to the next player.

The first player to reach or exceed 100 points in their overall score wins the game!
